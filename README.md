# Dojiâœ¨
- a doji has no real body or only a very small one
- why: the open and close are at or very near the same level
- on its own a doji does not tell you much..other than there is indecisiveness in the market
- however, it gains meaning based on the bars preceding it..may signal a transition

- ![doji image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0ff804_4ecb66962edf43588a16255707941dde~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_608%2Cal_c%2Cq_80,enc_auto/file.jpg)

```
- doji after prolonged upterend means buteyers are coming to an end of their bullish enthusiams
- after a series of white/greeen bars
- called a brerish doji star
```
so basically doji is a transitional indicator, and tells that trend(up/down) is going to change. Stronger the previosu trend...more likely the doji is correctly signaling a change

There are certain doji shapes that have extra meaning

## important and another way to interpret doji's
```
- for example we see a doji in a rising trend it can be downtrend or uptrend doesen't 
- matter , but even after a doji if we see that the trend is not reversed then it might be - sign that be are goona see a strong trend because the doji's could'nt throw it off
```

# Doji shadow indicators
- Shadow can Provide special meaning when
- the real body is a doji
- the shadow is missing
- the shadow is extremely long

Common shadow patterns to watch for... and they can have interesting names!

# DragonFly DojiðŸ’¸
- Long Lower Shadow
    - Open,high and close were the same
    - sellers trying to drive price down and establish a new low but did not suceed

interpratation (Always need to look at bars preceeding a doji)
- preceeding bars are in a downtrend...then buyers are emergin and downtrend may be ending
- preceeding bars are in an uptrend...then sellers are emerging, preventing buyers from moving the price higher and uptrend may be ending

# GraveStone DojiðŸ’¸
- Open,Low and Close were the same
- Buyers trying to drive price up and establish a new high but did not succeed

interpretation (Always need to look at bars preceding a doji)
- Preceeding bars in a uptrend...then sellers are emering and uptrend may be ending
- preceeding bars are in a downtrend...then buyers are emerging , preventing sellers from moving the price lower and the downtrend may be ending

# Missing shadows
- # Shaven Top
    - open is at the high and all the donwhill from here (Double Bearish)
        - down day plus no new buying occured after the open
    - Close is at the high(Bullish)
- # Shaven Bottom
    - Open at the low, buyers dominated (Bullish)
    - Close is at the low, sellers dominated (Bearish)

    # Really Long Missing Shadows
    - Shadow is as long or longer than the real body
        - traders are inidicating a senitiment extreme
        - May or may not follow through into the next day so can be tricky
        - Again...judge relative to preceeding bars

    - # Long upper shadow (high of day well above open and close)
        - price serires in an uptrend, long upper shadow shows failure to close at higher high...may signal uptrend is over
        - price series in a downtrend, long upper shadow shwos some buyers are buying at higher levels...may signal downtrend is over

    - # Long Lower Shadow (Low of day well below open and close)
        - price series in a uptrend, long lower shadow shows traders not willing to buy at higher levels right up to the close. Exiting at the high and may think new highs not justified...may signal uptrend is decelerating or ending

        - Price series in a downtrend, long lower shadow shows failure to close at the low...may signal downtrendi weakening or over

- Candlestick patterns can be very helpful indicators,however two candlestick patterns can have different meanings depending on where they fall in a serires,  some people just trade candlestick patterns

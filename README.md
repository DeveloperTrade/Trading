# CandleSticks
- more visual
- simple to use and interpret
- patterns have discriptive names (GraveStone doji)
- patterns are widly known so you can expect other trades to respond in a specific way to specific patterns
- can use on any chart with other indicators
- can have dramatic shapes so can grab your attention to trend change fast than standard bar
- help to recognize turning point such as uptrend to a downtrend

- ![candlestick img](https://www.incrediblecharts.com/images/candlesticks/candlestick-colors.svg)

# Dojiâœ¨
- a doji has no real body or only a very small one
- why: the open and close are at or very near the same level
- on its own a doji does not tell you much..other than there is indecisiveness in the market
- however, it gains meaning based on the bars preceding it..may signal a transition

- ![doji image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0ff804_4ecb66962edf43588a16255707941dde~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_608%2Cal_c%2Cq_80,enc_auto/file.jpg)

```
- doji after prolonged upterend means buteyers are coming to an end of their bullish enthusiams
- after a series of white/greeen bars
- called a brerish doji star
```
so basically doji is a transitional indicator, and tells that trend(up/down) is going to change. Stronger the previosu trend...more likely the doji is correctly signaling a change

There are certain doji shapes that have extra meaning

## important and another way to interpret doji's
```
- for example we see a doji in a rising trend it can be downtrend or uptrend doesen't 
- matter , but even after a doji if we see that the trend is not reversed then it might be - sign that be are goona see a strong trend because the doji's could'nt throw it off
```

# Doji shadow indicators
- Shadow can Provide special meaning when
- the real body is a doji
- the shadow is missing
- the shadow is extremely long

Common shadow patterns to watch for... and they can have interesting names!

# DragonFly DojiðŸ’¸
- Long Lower Shadow
    - Open,high and close were the same
    - sellers trying to drive price down and establish a new low but did not suceed

interpratation (Always need to look at bars preceeding a doji)
- preceeding bars are in a downtrend...then buyers are emergin and downtrend may be ending
- preceeding bars are in an uptrend...then sellers are emerging, preventing buyers from moving the price higher and uptrend may be ending

# GraveStone DojiðŸ’¸
- Open,Low and Close were the same
- Buyers trying to drive price up and establish a new high but did not succeed

interpretation (Always need to look at bars preceding a doji)
- Preceeding bars in a uptrend...then sellers are emering and uptrend may be ending
- preceeding bars are in a downtrend...then buyers are emerging , preventing sellers from moving the price lower and the downtrend may be ending

# Missing shadows
- # Shaven Top
    - open is at the high and all the donwhill from here (Double Bearish)
        - down day plus no new buying occured after the open
    - Close is at the high(Bullish)
- # Shaven Bottom
    - Open at the low, buyers dominated (Bullish)
    - Close is at the low, sellers dominated (Bearish)

    # Really Long Missing Shadows
    - Shadow is as long or longer than the real body
        - traders are inidicating a senitiment extreme
        - May or may not follow through into the next day so can be tricky
        - Again...judge relative to preceeding bars

    - # Long upper shadow (high of day well above open and close)
        - price serires in an uptrend, long upper shadow shows failure to close at higher high...may signal uptrend is over
        - price series in a downtrend, long upper shadow shwos some buyers are buying at higher levels...may signal downtrend is over

    - # Long Lower Shadow (Low of day well below open and close)
        - price series in a uptrend, long lower shadow shows traders not willing to buy at higher levels right up to the close. Exiting at the high and may think new highs not justified...may signal uptrend is decelerating or ending

        - Price series in a downtrend, long lower shadow shows failure to close at the low...may signal downtrendi weakening or over

- Candlestick patterns can be very helpful indicators,however two candlestick patterns can have different meanings depending on where they fall in a serires,  some people just trade candlestick patterns

## Lets take a look at some CandleStick patterns
- # Hammer
    - established downtrend
    - marks the end of a downtrend
    - sellers able to create a new low buyt last-minute buying overcame it and created a higher close
- ![hammer pattern photo](https://fxpipsgainer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hammer-Candlesticks-Pattern.png)

- # Hanging Man
    - Established uptrend
    - marks the end of an uptrend...time to sell at a profit
    - Bulls unable to keep bears from making a new low and from keeping the close below the open
- ![hanging man pattern photo](https://www.forexboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hanging-Man-Candlestick-Pattern-Summary.jpg)

- # Harami
    - ![harami pattern photo](https://a.c-dn.net/b/0csr13/harami-candlestick-patterns_body_2019_07_15_14_03_33_Document3_Word.png.full.png)
    - Small real body comes after a bigger body one
        - green followed by red(Bearish)
        - Red followed by green(Bullish)

    - Indicates a change in sentiment is coming
    - the smaller the real body, the more powerful inidication that a reversal is coming    

- # Engulfing CandleStick
    - ![engulfing pattern](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/getmedia/47ceb3ae-1bb3-4786-8c00-c851d45536a1/Engulfing-Candlesticks-1.jpg.aspx)

    - Signals reversal of a trend
    - 2nd Bar Key (Wait for It) (we should wait for the another candle to form for a confirmation )
        - Engulfs (Wider Range than the day before)
        - Higher Open -Lower Close (Bearish)
        - Lower Open - Higher Close (Bullish)

- # Shooting star
    - ![shooting star photo](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/getmedia/44abeef4-e6e1-42aa-8572-779fdabd45ae/Shooting-star-pattern_1.jpg.aspx)
    - Small real body and long upper shadow
    - implies failure of the trend..failure to close near the high
    - it sometimes can come with a doji, and if a doji had came already then we can already see that there is indecisiveness in the market

- # Window
    - ![window pattern photo](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mE1kY657Uxk/maxresdefault.jpg)

- # Three White Soliders and Crow
    - ![three white soldiers and crow pattern photo](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oIH-Z8Qqmxk/XiiifeGx3KI/AAAAAAAAhUI/WZg73oZ2PWYDMJ2NRhZly2AGeJOVyrW1gCLcBGAsYHQ/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/three-white-soldiers-pattern-strading-stocks.JPG)

    - Three long green bars
        -  consistently all in a row
        - continuation of the uptrend
        - stronger indicators: Top wick short, close at or near high


    - Three Red (Or black) crows    
        - three long red bars
        - consistently all in a row
        - continuation of the downtrend
        - stronger indicator: Bottom wick short, close at or near low


## Trend Lines
    - Remember "trend is your friend"
    - straight Line
        - Done using trading platform
    - Could be upward or downward
    - Give you confidence to buy or sell
    - Dont worry if not perfect lines as not exact and may have  a sideways market at times and outliers
    - the key is to be consistent
    - ![hello world](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/600_Fidelity_Com_English/images/migration/Support%20and%20Resistance.png)

## Uptrend ( Buy at low[support] sell at top[resistance] )
- start at lowest low and connect to the next lowest low that precedes a new high
- as long as new highs are being made, redraw the line to connect the lowest low before the last high
- when prices stop making new Hights, stop drawing
    - extrend the line the same slope into the future

    ## Support line entry rule
    - Buy on the 2nd or 3rd touch of the support line
    ## Support line exit rule
    - Sell as soon as possible after low falls below the support line (Trend Broken)

    ## important
    - in order to check that how much reliable that trend line is we should wait for the 2 or 3 touch 

## Downtrend (Resistance line)
- start at highest high and connect to the next high that precedes a new low
- as long as new lows are being made, redraw the line to connect the highest high before the last low
- When prices stop making new lows, stop drawing
    - Extend the line at the same slope into the future

## Channels (sideways)
- Simply Draw support and resistanc elines ont eh same chart
- take note of which one is the predominant trend

## Identify false trend line breaks
- Once a trendline is broken... the trend is over
- You will be very served following this rule
- Takes emotion and hope of out it

- However, false breaks do happen
    - how to Identify
    - strategy to deal with them

### Note: false breakouts actually are not false, it really did happend, the line was crossed, but what ends up being false is the concluson you draw, in a way you are misled

## how to Identify?
- did the breakout occur as part of the range or did the final close break it as well?
- 'close breakage' means less likely to be random or noise related

- ## Trading Volume
    - High volume or volume spike often accompanies the end of strong trend
        - Buying or selling frenzy
    - Steep volume decline shows overall interest is wanning and may signal a breakout
    - Steady volume then less likely for a breakout but be wary as any cross of the trendline is always significant
    - Using inidicators can also play  a role in corfimaing a breakout or might be signaling the breakout for us in advance

## Strategic approch to false breakouts
- ## Support line break
    - 1. adjust your stop loss ot lock in profits( trail stop loss)
    - 2. Adjust the total money comitted to the trade.
        - Sell some but not all to reduce risk and lock in some profit
        - Sell all later, on a more definite sell signal
- ## Resistance line break
    - 1 Wait for 2nd or 3rd touch to buy into new uptrend
    - 2 Sell short (Beting price will conitnuire to go down) at #2 or #3 touch of the resistance line
    - 3 Close your short-poisition at resistance line breakout (Book profits)

## Filter approch to false trendline breakouts
- Amount (%) of the break , before taking action
- Duration (Time) of the break, before taking action
- for example 
    - No Sell, break < 10%
    - Sell, Close break > 5%
    - no sell on 1st day, BUT sell on 2nd full day below support line

# to summarize
- tend is an indicator (Tool)
- can be upawrd or downward
- great to combine wiht other trading indicators
- further confirmation and confidence in your trade
- if no trend, no indication , no trade
- "trend is your friend"
- trading on trends means you are not always in the markte on all teh securities you follow
- you have to be patient with trendlines. let the trend develop
- dont try to make to trendline fit


# Chart patterns
- continuation patterns
- reversal patterns

 -  ## Continuation pattern (gives breakout in the original trend direction)
    - in an established trend there may be a "pause" in buying and selling...trend is losing steam  
    - when you see a continuation pattern that is indicating that the trend will accelerate again after the pause
    - feel good you idnentified the trend correctly
    - Trade continuation patterns
        - Uptrend
            - not sell and ride price up further
            - add more to your poisition
        
        - Downtrend
            - Need to continue to wait out the downtrend before buying in

## Ascending triangle (continuation pattern)
- Higher hight not made but uptrend will continue
- it is very likely to give breakout in the previous trend direction + also the ascending triangel itselfs forms the uptrend so having the previous trend in the uptrend is a win win
- prices not making new lows either
- 3rd touch of support line strong confirmation
- Plus, Can use a 2nd inidicator to further confirm the buy signal
- ![ascending traingle](https://a.c-dn.net/b/0BqoZ6/ascending-triangle-pattern_body_Ascendingtriangleexplained.png.full.png)


## Desending triangle (continuation pattern)
- Lower lows not made but downtred will continue
- prices not making new highs either
- ![desending triangle](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-7.png)

## Flag (continuation)
- Continuation pattern with a dramatic but breif reversal
- looks like a flag (pennat) on a flagpole
- similar to triangle
- sharp rise or fall
- its more likely to continue to the original trend after the pattern has been completed
- lots of trading volume at the base of the flag pole

## Rectangle (Continuation)
- if you were to draw two lines...forming a reactange..what may it loo like on the chart
- think about connecting high-high and low-low with horizontal lines
- ![rectangle](https://investobull.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bullish-Rectangle-Pattern-1024x580.png)
- rectangle could be a part of a trend (Channel)

## Dead cat Bounce chart pattern (continuation)
- Downside breakaway gap on bad news (25-70%)
- Bounce (Dead cat hits the floor)
    - Short-Term, does not reach original pre-gap price
    - resumes string downtrend (continuation pattern)
- trade on Bounce..but be ready to get out
- while bouncing as soon as it reaches the breakaway gap of the downtrend we should exit the trade because afer that it will go down and coniutnue in the down trend
- ![dead cat bounce](https://forexbee.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dead-cat-bounce-pattern-1.png)

## Cup with handle pattern (continuation)
- Combines price pattern, volume levels and moving averages indicators
- continuation pattern that takes time to develop but strong indicator when it does
- the longer 'U' shaped cup more predictable than a 'V' shape cup
- Cup should not be very deep
- it should not move below simple moving average(SMA) line
- ![](https://www.strike.money/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CUPAND4.jpg)

# Reversal patterns
- ## Double Bottom pattern (Reversal)
    - ![](https://cdn-0.forexbee.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/double-bottom-trading-strategy.webp)
    - Looks like a W
    - Retest of a low
    - Predicts price breakout to the upside ...under certain conditions
    - ### Conidtions to be met
        - Minumium 10 days between the lows could be 2-3 months, it means that there should be atleast a 10 day gap between those 2 bottoms
        - Variation between the lows no more than 4%, it should be alingned same on the support zone
        - Center up move min 10% from the lover of the two bottoms
        - price must move above the confirmation

- ## Double Top Pattern (Reversal)
    - ![double top](https://cdn-0.forexbee.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/double-top-trading-rules.webp)
    - ### Conidtions to be met
        - Minumium 10 days between the highs could be 2-3 months, it means that there should be atleast a 10 day gap between those 2 bottoms
        - Variation between the highs no more than 4%, it should be alingned same on the resistance zone
        - Center down move min 10% from the higher of the two tops
        - price must move below the confirmation line

- ## Head and Shoulders (Reversal)
    - ![head and shoulders](https://d24uab5gycr2uz.cloudfront.net/uploads/other_pic/HwspssEjoy.png)

# Moving averages: Great indicator and trading Tool
- Key component of technical analysis
- Smooths out pricing
- adjusts for pricing outliers
- can be used with other inidicators
- helps to Identify trends and certain actions to take
- Important points that one should know
    - lagging indicator ( not forecasting ) or trend following
    - you dont have to try and figure out start and end points (Like a hand drawn trendline)..all mathematic
    - subjective part is chooing the type of moving average and how many periods (Ex, days) to calculate

    - ## Simple moving average (SMA)
        - prices(10 days)
        - 20,24,22,33,31,29,28,29,29
        - average = 245/10 = $24.5
        - on 11th day drop day 1 and add day 11
        - 24,22,33,31,29,28,29,29,32
        - average = 257/10 = $25.7
        - this process repeats on each day and that is how the moving average line is created
        - we can also use more than 1 moving average that is both for different time frames for example one for 200 days and second for 50 days

    - ## What is Crossover Rule?
        - Buy: price crosses above the moving average line
        - Sell: prices crosses below the moving average

    - ## how to overcome whipsaws(sideways) market when they are frequently crossing up and below the moving average?ðŸ¤”
        - Use filters to "Filter Out" Valid buy/sell signals from false signals
        - Time: price ahs to remain above/below crossover point for x number of periods
        - Extent: Price had to supass the moving average value by X%
        - Volume: Crossover has to be accompanied by a significant rise in volume
        - Extreme sentimemt: Uptrend, the low has to surpass the moving average, not just the close and in a downtrend, teh high has to be under the moving average, not just the close. Looking at wick (range) in a candlestick. 

        - Alternative to more popular crossover
            - call end to trend when
                - uptrend: Moving average today is less than yesterday
                - donwtrend: Moving average today is higher than yesterday
            - can call the end of trend faster than the crossover rule
            - still suffers from lag and whipsaws but alternative and could use as a filter

    - ## Weighted moving average
        - You want the moving average to be more reflective of the most recent price
        - Makes sense..not buying 200 days ago, buying today
        - you could reduce the number of days in the SMA(Simple Moving Average)
        - ***Put More weight on more recent days***
        - for example: prices (5 days) are 202,24,22,33,31
        - Average = 130/5 = $26.00
        - but in the case of Weighted average we put more weights on the most recent days
            - Weighted average = (20*1)+(24*2)+(22*3)+(33*4)+(31*5)
            - [20+48+66+132+155]/(1+2+3+4+5) (these are weights not days)
            - 421/15 = $28.06

    - ## Exponentail Moving average (Popular)
        - ***Even more weights to recent days***
        - the weighting given to the most recent price is greater for a shorter-period EMA than for a long-period EMA
        - For example, an 18.18% multiplier is applied ot the most recent price data for a 10-day EMA, whereas for a 20 day EMA, only a 9.52% multiplier weighting is used

    - ## Adaptive moving average
        - Push Pull: Short time frame to identify beginning of trend quickly and long as necessary to avoid constant buy/sell activity (Whipsaws)
        - Sometimes want small number of days and sometimes high number of days...but you do not force it because not sure which is right?
        - adaptive moving averages use complex adn automated calculations to do this by detrending the series to make the current price most important
    
    - ## Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA)
        - Developed by Perry Kaufman
        - KAMA will closely follow prices when the price swings are relatively small and the noise is low.
        - Complex formula with multiple layers
        - kaufman recommends settings of:
            - 10 is the number of periods for the efficienty ratio (ER).
            - 2 is the number of perioids for the fastest exponential moving average EMA constant
            - 20 is the number of perioids for the slowest EMA constant 
    - Which moving average should you use??
        - Most sensitive to recent price moves
            - SMA
            - WMA
            - EMA or KAMA

        - Time Frame
            - Short time frame moving average respond quickly to new coniditions
            - Longer time frame reduces errors
    
    - ## Moving average Limitations
        - Moving averages limitations...very useful but nothing is perfect
        - Sideways movement
            - By nature, when price is not trending (Moving Sideways) then hard to predict next move
            - Whipsaw (Frequent price change above adn below the crossover line)
            - The value in sideways movement is to recognize that is occuring and adjust or wait for a trend to appear  
            - use other tools with moving average to identify actions to take
        - Noise
            - Disorderly chart with lots of outliers (Noisey)
            - Problem is a noisy chart will give off more false buy/sell indicators
            - Fix by applying a moving average with more days in it
                - outliers get smoothed out more and becomes less of an outlier
                - However, longer time frames increases lag
        - Lag
            - See a dramtic price move, see potential profits, but you are a disiplined investor who needs to wait a few days for the lagging moving average to catch up to create a crossover
            - Meanwhile, losing out on profits waiting for that to happen
            - fix by applying a moving average wiht less days in it
                - will be more sensitive to recent price
        - Notice the conflict
            - Noise: Fix by applying a moving average with "***more days***" in it
            - Lag: Fix by applying a moving average with "***less days***" in it

            Unfortunately, there is no magic number of days
                - the best number is one that's reduces the noise without adding too much lag
            - Alternativetly, you could focus on a security that is more orderly , less noisy
            - Another option...Use Multiple Moving Averages as strategy
    - ## Multiple moving average as an indicator
        - One chart, More than one moving average timeline/type
        - what looking for is not price crossing a moving average but a shorter moving average (ex 5 days) crossing a longer moving average (ex 20 days)
        - 5 and 20 day is a common combination as in effect comparing one week of prices (5 days) and one month (20days)
        - however you can choose and experiment with your own timelines
        - ***BUY***: When the shorter moving average line crosses the longer moving average on the upside (Above)
        - ***SELL***: When the shorter moving average line crosses the longer moving average on the downside (Below)
        - between the 2 moving average we can see the gap and that is what called  "DayLight" if there is more daylight we can also use this to confirm that it is making a good amount of gap just to be sure that the trend reversal is gonna be for real

    - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
        - it is so widely used that is is many times a default setting on a trading platform
        - tries to overcome challenge of a disciplined investor waiting for the price to cross a moving average or one moving average to cross another
        - You can see it forming but you wish you could take-action now
        - it overcomes that challenge for waiting for that crossover to occur and gives an early chance to make a poisition
        - with crossovers you see a merge (turning point) approaching and then a new direction may occur
        - By the time the crossover occurs the absolute peak/trough has already passed
        - Would be nice to visually see or quantify that...that is where the MACD comes in
        - ***Convergence***
            - Indicates the trend may be coming to and end
            - Can be an early warning signal
        - ***Divergence (Going Aprt or "More Daylight")***
            - Current trend safe from crossover (Reversal)
            - At least for a few more periods
            - However, abnormally wide divergence are not sustainable and can be a warning that prices have reach an extreme (Peak/Bottom)
        
        - ***how macd is calulcated??***  v
            - Long-term moving average prices are subtracted from the short-term moving average prices
            - Trading platform does that automatically and create a nice line chart
            - Created By Gerald Appel and he used Exponentail moving averates(EPA) of 26 and 12 days ...although you can the paramters you choose
        - ## Some common Moving Average
            - 20 day moving average stands out
            - 20 days equal 1 months of trading days
            - Well know and observerd by the trading community...almost a self-fulfilling prophesy
            - When a security is trending
                - Common, 20 day moving average works like a support line, Seller s stop selling when it is reached 
                - Less common, 20 day moving average works like a resistance line...Buyers stop buying when it is reached

            - 50 day
            - 100 day
            - 200 day

            - ## Death Cross 
                - Death cross is simply when the 50 day moving average crossing below the 200 day moving average
                    - no statistical advantage over any other crossing pattern.Actaully, since longer time perioids could be more of a lag
                    - Traders recognize a Death Cross so may be a self-fulfilling prophesy
            
            - ## Golden Cross
                - Golden Cross is when the 50 day moving average crosses above the 200 day moving average 
            - Some would say Death Cross means wider bear market and golden cross means wider bull market

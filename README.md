# CandleSticks
- more visual
- simple to use and interpret
- patterns have discriptive names (GraveStone doji)
- patterns are widly known so you can expect other trades to respond in a specific way to specific patterns
- can use on any chart with other indicators
- can have dramatic shapes so can grab your attention to trend change fast than standard bar
- help to recognize turning point such as uptrend to a downtrend

- ![candlestick img](https://www.incrediblecharts.com/images/candlesticks/candlestick-colors.svg)

# Dojiâœ¨
- a doji has no real body or only a very small one
- why: the open and close are at or very near the same level
- on its own a doji does not tell you much..other than there is indecisiveness in the market
- however, it gains meaning based on the bars preceding it..may signal a transition

- ![doji image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0ff804_4ecb66962edf43588a16255707941dde~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_608%2Cal_c%2Cq_80,enc_auto/file.jpg)

```
- doji after prolonged upterend means buteyers are coming to an end of their bullish enthusiams
- after a series of white/greeen bars
- called a brerish doji star
```
so basically doji is a transitional indicator, and tells that trend(up/down) is going to change. Stronger the previosu trend...more likely the doji is correctly signaling a change

There are certain doji shapes that have extra meaning

## important and another way to interpret doji's
```
- for example we see a doji in a rising trend it can be downtrend or uptrend doesen't 
- matter , but even after a doji if we see that the trend is not reversed then it might be - sign that be are goona see a strong trend because the doji's could'nt throw it off
```

# Doji shadow indicators
- Shadow can Provide special meaning when
- the real body is a doji
- the shadow is missing
- the shadow is extremely long

Common shadow patterns to watch for... and they can have interesting names!

# DragonFly DojiðŸ’¸
- Long Lower Shadow
    - Open,high and close were the same
    - sellers trying to drive price down and establish a new low but did not suceed

interpratation (Always need to look at bars preceeding a doji)
- preceeding bars are in a downtrend...then buyers are emergin and downtrend may be ending
- preceeding bars are in an uptrend...then sellers are emerging, preventing buyers from moving the price higher and uptrend may be ending

# GraveStone DojiðŸ’¸
- Open,Low and Close were the same
- Buyers trying to drive price up and establish a new high but did not succeed

interpretation (Always need to look at bars preceding a doji)
- Preceeding bars in a uptrend...then sellers are emering and uptrend may be ending
- preceeding bars are in a downtrend...then buyers are emerging , preventing sellers from moving the price lower and the downtrend may be ending

# Missing shadows
- # Shaven Top
    - open is at the high and all the donwhill from here (Double Bearish)
        - down day plus no new buying occured after the open
    - Close is at the high(Bullish)
- # Shaven Bottom
    - Open at the low, buyers dominated (Bullish)
    - Close is at the low, sellers dominated (Bearish)

    # Really Long Missing Shadows
    - Shadow is as long or longer than the real body
        - traders are inidicating a senitiment extreme
        - May or may not follow through into the next day so can be tricky
        - Again...judge relative to preceeding bars

    - # Long upper shadow (high of day well above open and close)
        - price serires in an uptrend, long upper shadow shows failure to close at higher high...may signal uptrend is over
        - price series in a downtrend, long upper shadow shwos some buyers are buying at higher levels...may signal downtrend is over

    - # Long Lower Shadow (Low of day well below open and close)
        - price series in a uptrend, long lower shadow shows traders not willing to buy at higher levels right up to the close. Exiting at the high and may think new highs not justified...may signal uptrend is decelerating or ending

        - Price series in a downtrend, long lower shadow shows failure to close at the low...may signal downtrendi weakening or over

- Candlestick patterns can be very helpful indicators,however two candlestick patterns can have different meanings depending on where they fall in a serires,  some people just trade candlestick patterns

## Lets take a look at some CandleStick patterns
- # Hammer
    - established downtrend
    - marks the end of a downtrend

    - Small real body comes after a bigger body one
        - green followed by red(Bearish)
        - Red followed by green(Bullish)

    - Indicates a change in sentiment is coming
    - the smaller the real body, the more powerful inidication that a reversal is coming    

- # Engulfing CandleStick
    - ![engulfing pattern](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/getmedia/47ceb3ae-1bb3-4786-8c00-c851d45536a1/Engulfing-Candlesticks-1.jpg.aspx)

    - Signals reversal of a trend
    - 2nd Bar Key (Wait for It) (we should wait for the another candle to form for a confirmation )

    - Small real body and long upper shadow
    - implies failure of the trend..failure to close near the high
    - it sometimes can come with a doji, and if a doji had came already then we can already see that there is indecisiveness in the market

    - ![hello world](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/600_Fidelity_Com_English/images/migration/Support%20and%20Resistance.png)

## Uptrend ( Buy at low[support] sell at top[resistance] )
- start at lowest low and connect to the next lowest low that precedes a new high
- as long as new highs are being made, redraw the line to connect the lowest low before the last high
- when prices stop making new Hights, stop drawing
    - extrend the line the same slope into the future

    ## Support line entry rule
    - Buy on the 2nd or 3rd touch of the support line
    ## Support line exit rule
    - Sell as soon as possible after low falls below the support line (Trend Broken)

    ## important
    - in order to check that how much reliable that trend line is we should wait for the 2 or 3 touch 

## Downtrend (Resistance line)
- start at highest high and connect to the next high that precedes a new low
- as long as new lows are being made, redraw the line to connect the highest high before the last low
- When prices stop making new lows, stop drawing
    - Extend the line at the same slope into the future

## Channels (sideways)
- Simply Draw support and resistanc elines ont eh same chart
- take note of which one is the predominant trend

## Identify false trend line breaks
- Once a trendline is broken... the trend is over
- You will be very served following this rule
- Takes emotion and hope of out it

- However, false breaks do happen
    - how to Identify
    - strategy to deal with them

### Note: false breakouts actually are not false, it really did happend, the line was crossed, but what ends up being false is the concluson you draw, in a way you are misled

## how to Identify?
- did the breakout occur as part of the range or did the final close break it as well?
- 'close breakage' means less likely to be random or noise related

- ## Trading Volume
    - High volume or volume spike often accompanies the end of strong trend
        - Buying or selling frenzy
    - Steep volume decline shows overall interest is wanning and may signal a breakout
    - Steady volume then less likely for a breakout but be wary as any cross of the trendline is always significant
    - Using inidicators can also play  a role in corfimaing a breakout or might be signaling the breakout for us in advance

## Strategic approch to false breakouts
- ## Support line break
    - 1. adjust your stop loss ot lock in profits( trail stop loss)
    - 2. Adjust the total money comitted to the trade.
        - Sell some but not all to reduce risk and lock in some profit
        - Sell all later, on a more definite sell signal
- ## Resistance line break
    - 1 Wait for 2nd or 3rd touch to buy into new uptrend
    - 2 Sell short (Beting price will conitnuire to go down) at #2 or #3 touch of the resistance line
    - 3 Close your short-poisition at resistance line breakout (Book profits)

## Filter approch to false trendline breakouts
- Amount (%) of the break , before taking action
- Duration (Time) of the break, before taking action
- for example 
    - No Sell, break < 10%
    - Sell, Close break > 5%
    - no sell on 1st day, BUT sell on 2nd full day below support line

# to summarize
- tend is an indicator (Tool)
- can be upawrd or downward
- great to combine wiht other trading indicators
- further confirmation and confidence in your trade
- if no trend, no indication , no trade
- "trend is your friend"
- trading on trends means you are not always in the markte on all teh securities you follow
- you have to be patient with trendlines. let the trend develop
- dont try to make to trendline fit


# Chart patterns
- continuation patterns
- reversal patterns

 -  ## Continuation pattern (gives breakout in the original trend direction)
    - in an established trend there may be a "pause" in buying and selling...trend is losing steam  
    - when you see a continuation pattern that is indicating that the trend will accelerate again after the pause
    - feel good you idnentified the trend correctly
    - Trade continuation patterns
        - Uptrend
            - not sell and ride price up further
            - add more to your poisition
        
        - Downtrend
            - Need to continue to wait out the downtrend before buying in

## Ascending triangle (continuation pattern)
- Higher hight not made but uptrend will continue
- it is very likely to give breakout in the previous trend direction + also the ascending triangel itselfs forms the uptrend so having the previous trend in the uptrend is a win win
- prices not making new lows either
- 3rd touch of support line strong confirmation
- Plus, Can use a 2nd inidicator to further confirm the buy signal
- ![ascending traingle](https://a.c-dn.net/b/0BqoZ6/ascending-triangle-pattern_body_Ascendingtriangleexplained.png.full.png)


## Desending triangle (continuation pattern)
- Lower lows not made but downtred will continue
- prices not making new highs either
- ![desending triangle](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-7.png)

## Flag (continuation)
- Continuation pattern with a dramatic but breif reversal
- looks like a flag (pennat) on a flagpole
- similar to triangle
- sharp rise or fall
- its more likely to continue to the original trend after the pattern has been completed
- lots of trading volume at the base of the flag pole

## Rectangle (Continuation)
- if you were to draw two lines...forming a reactange..what may it loo like on the chart
- think about connecting high-high and low-low with horizontal lines
- ![rectangle](https://investobull.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bullish-Rectangle-Pattern-1024x580.png)
- rectangle could be a part of a trend (Channel)

## Dead cat Bounce chart pattern (continuation)
- Downside breakaway gap on bad news (25-70%)
- Bounce (Dead cat hits the floor)
    - Short-Term, does not reach original pre-gap price
    - resumes string downtrend (continuation pattern)
- trade on Bounce..but be ready to get out
- while bouncing as soon as it reaches the breakaway gap of the downtrend we should exit the trade because afer that it will go down and coniutnue in the down trend
- ![dead cat bounce](https://forexbee.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dead-cat-bounce-pattern-1.png)

## Cup with handle pattern (continuation)
- Combines price pattern, volume levels and moving averages indicators
- continuation pattern that takes time to develop but strong indicator when it does
- the longer 'U' shaped cup more predictable than a 'V' shape cup
- Cup should not be very deep
- it should not move below simple moving average(SMA) line
